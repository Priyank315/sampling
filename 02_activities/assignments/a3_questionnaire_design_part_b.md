# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The quality of the sample should be relatively high if we successfully implement a stratified random sampling approach. By ensuring representation from different departments and including both current and 
    former employees, the sample will capture a diverse range of experiences and insights across various roles and departments. 
    
    However, there may still be a bias if former employees who left due to dissatisfaction are more motivated to respond, while satisfied employees may not participate as readily. 
    This response bias could limit the representativeness of the sample.

In general, though, by diversifying the sample to include various departments and levels of satisfaction, we expect it to be fairly representative of the target population of entry- and lower-level employees.

    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
   Based on class content about potential errors, survey quality, and ethical considerations, I would make a few adjustments to improve data accuracy, reduce bias, and ensure ethical standards are upheld:

Add a Confidentiality Assurance Statement: Informing respondents that their responses are confidential may encourage honest feedback.

Include Demographic Questions: To ensure we are capturing a range of perspectives, adding questions about department, role, and tenure length will allow for better data segmentation and analysis.

Reduce Leading Language: Questions regarding management and compensation could unintentionally bias responses if phrased negatively. Revising questions to be more neutral can reduce this risk.

Add a Question on Future Intentions: For current employees, I would add a question about their intent to stay in the near future, which could provide insight into possible future turnover trends.

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, the purpose of this survey could not have been fully met through an observational study. 
    Observational studies would allow us to gather information on factors such as employee demographics, roles, and turnover rates, but they would not capture employeesâ€™ personal reasons for leaving, 
    levels of job satisfaction, or perceptions of workplace conditions. 
    Surveying provides insights into subjective factors directly related to employees' decision-making processes, which are critical to understanding and addressing turnover.

    ```

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
